          Trump's All About The Base, But He Likely Needs More Than That — Here's Why

          <em>NPR.org, September 5, 2019 · </em>Many heads got scratched this week when President Trump doubled down on his erroneous claim that Alabama had been in the path of Hurricane Dorian.

          <br> <br>Apparently relying on a map that warned of high winds, or another showing hypothetical paths for the storm, the president over the weekend insisted Alabama was "in the crosshairs." At midweek, sitting in the Oval Office, he held up a map on which someone using a marking pen had ballooned the area of actual hurricane threat to include Alabama.

          <br><br>The question had to be asked: Wouldn't it be enough to be worried about Florida, Georgia and the rest of the Southeastern coast without dragging in Alabama — a state outside the current danger zone?

          <br><br>Perhaps. But in seeking to understand the moment it was tempting to observe that Alabama is arguably the cornerstone of the president's base of support in seeking a second term.

<br><br>While 17 states have consistently shown the president at 50% job approval or better, <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">according to Gallup</span>, Alabama is one of just three states where Trump's approval has often topped 60% since Inauguration Day. According to the <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">Morning Consult</span> tracking poll, Trump's approval is 18 points positive in West Virginia and 21 in Wyoming. In Alabama, it is 26, and Alabama has more votes in the Electoral College than those two other states combined.

<br><br>Do such things matter to a president seeking reelection? They just might, especially when that president is struggling to raise his public approval nationwide.

<br><br>The president is setting his course on issues, from guns and trade to immigration and abortion, and his stances on those make it clear he is playing to his base. All politicians want as many voters as they can get, and all begin their calculations by relying on a core of support. But in American presidential politics, the ultimate question is not just how many voters one has but where they live, because in American presidential politics, the Electoral College rules.

<br><br>While much time and attention is devoted to tracking the president's approval rating nationwide, and his supporters can be found in any part of the country, all that matters in the end is the president's standing state by state. Examining trends in individual states offers a clearer picture of Trump's reelection prospects a little more than a year from now — and a rationale for his strategy.
