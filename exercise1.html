          find some copy from a news or magazine article online
        </h1>
        <h2>
          using copy from that article, set the opening spread of that article
        </h2>
        <p>
          you can only use html type and css styling to style the opening spread
        </p>

          focus on how you can use html typography intentionally!
        </p>
        <p>
          many of the same rules apply to type online as they do in other contexts,
          what does a readable paragraph look like, how can you establish hierarchy, or enforce a grid?
        </p>
        <p>
          one thing to be mindful of is how html and css comes with default styling that may not be what
          you want, the spacing between these paragraphs as an example.
